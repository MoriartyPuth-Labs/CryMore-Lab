# CryMore Lab

A technical analysis and exploit demonstration for the "CryMore" challenge. This lab focuses on intercepting network traffic to bypass a binary's internal killswitch logic.

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### 1. Network Behavior
Upon execution, the program attempts to open a TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:44333`. It sends a specific HTTP GET request:
* `GET /neutralize HTTP/1.1`
* `User-Agent: crackme.one` 

### 2. Logic Analysis
The binary uses `strstr` to scan the server's response for the substring `200 OK`. 
* If the substring is found, the "neutralized" path is triggered.
* The response does not need to be a valid HTTP structure; only the literal string must be present.

## 🔓 Exploit: Local TCP Spoofing

The bypass was achieved by running a minimal local TCP listener using **Netcat** that replies with the required success string.

### Command:
```bash
while true; do
  printf "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc -l 127.0.0.1 44333
done
```
### Output
```
Malware successfully neutralized. Good job.
